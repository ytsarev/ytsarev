## 🧑‍💼 Short Bio

Born and raised in Russia, I relocated to the Czech Republic in 2010 to pursue my passion for open-source and join [**SUSE Linux**](https://www.suse.com/).

After SUSE, I’ve worked with leading firms in [**big data**](https://www.gooddata.com/), [**video streaming**](https://www.iflix.com/), [**consulting**](https://www.mckinsey.com/), and [**finance**](https://www.absa.africa/).

I eventually joined [**Upbound**](https://github.com/upbound) to spearhead the control plane revolution in cloud-native infrastructure.
